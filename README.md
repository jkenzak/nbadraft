# NBA Draft Prediction: Identifying Future All-Stars

## Overview
This project uses NCAA player statistics and NBA Draft Combine measurements to predict which players are most likely to become future NBA All-Stars. The model is designed from the perspective of a general manager making draft decisions, leveraging historical data and machine learning.

## Objectives
- **Identify Key Predictors** of NBA success using college stats and combine data
- **Train a Random Forest Classifier** to predict All-Star status
- **Assist NBA Front Offices** by generating actionable insights and rankings for draft prospects

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources
- [NBA Advanced Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced): Combine measurements (2000â€“2024)
- [RealGM](https://basketball.realgm.com/ncaa): NCAA player statistics (2003â€“2024)
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_All-Stars): All-Star selections

## Modeling Approach
- Built a binary classification model using **Random Forest**
- Input features included: scoring, playmaking, efficiency, rebounding, physical measurements
- Trained on past players to evaluate prospects from 2020â€“2024

## Sample Results
